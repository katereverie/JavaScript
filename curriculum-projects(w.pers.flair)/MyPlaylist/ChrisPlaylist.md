* Pick a fitting background design for these songs
  - What are their common themes? - sex, independence, Liebeskummer, unrequitted love - so, about oneself eventually.
  - What is the VIBE? - more self-affirming than self-destructive, a slight nonchalant undertone masked by confidence and self-assertion.
  - How would that vibe be represented in color schemes? rainbow: diverse and changable - but originates from one color: white! (so, the main theme is and has always been about oneself)
  - Confirm with Chris and ask for feedbacks. (He likes first design, thinks it is more sophisticated than the budget counter :_)
