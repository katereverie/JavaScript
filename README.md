# JavaScript-Basic

 This marks the learning process of JavaScript.

## *Clarification of Folder Structures*

1. Project Folders, for curriculum or for certification , consist of sub-folders. Each sub-folder contains only one corresponding project.
2. Each project contains at least one HTML file, one CSS file, and one JS file, and one MD file.
3. The MD file summarizes personal key takeways from doing the corresponding project.

### *On Key Takeaways*

This markdown document summarizes my takeways from doing the project following instructions.

In this sense, it is a summary of my own understanding of the key concepts involved in creating the project.

Since it is my own understanding, it is constrained to my understanding at that specific point of time.

So, this summary should be subject to future updates and potential corrections as my understanding shifts or gets corrected due to inaccurate/incomplete understanding of the matter at hand, or simply - misunderstanding/mistakes.

As these takeways are key to my own understanding, and I assume the involved concepts are key to JS, I see it necessary to document them, both as a demonstration of my own understanding, and as an object for retrospection.
