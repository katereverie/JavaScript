# What is SASS?

SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets.</br>
It is a *preprocessor scripting language* or specifically a *CSS preprocessor* that is interpreted or compiled into CSS. So, it is neither a library nor a framework in the traditional sense.
It is rather an *extension tool* that extends the functionality of CSS by adding features like *variables*, *nested rules*, and *mixins*, which help make stylesheets more maintainable and efficient to write.
