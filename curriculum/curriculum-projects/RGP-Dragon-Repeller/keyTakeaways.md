This markdown document summarizes my takeways from doing the project following instructions.
In this sense, it is a summary of my own understanding of the key concepts involved in creating the project.
Since it is my own understanding, it is constrained to my understanding at that specific point of time.
So, this summary should be subject to future updates and potential corrections as my understanding shifts or gets corrected due to inaccurate/incomplete understanding of the matter at hand, or simply - misunderstanding/mistakes. 
As these takeways are key to my own understanding, and I assume the involved concepts are key to JS,
I see it necessary to document them, both as a demonstration of my own understanding, and as an object for retrospection. 


Personal Takeaways that are subject to updates
1. objects are non primitive data types, meaning they are mutable, meaning primitive data types aren't. 
2. primitive data types (short: primitives) of JS are "undefined", "null", "boolean", "number", "string", "symbole".
3. keys of objects are of string type, even though when storing keys, as long as they are one character, double quotes aren't necessary
