### HTML element <dfn></dfn>
It is used to mark up the *defining* instance of a term within a document. It is typically used in conjunction with a glossary or to provide additional semantic meaning to specific terms within the content. 

### regex "\s*"
adding `*` to `\s` allows zero or more whitespace characters in a string. 

### array.filter()
Like `map()`, `filter()` also takes a callback which returns a boolean. 

### array.reduce()
takes an array and applies a callback to condense the array into a single value. This method takes a callback which takes two arguments. 
The first argument should be a callback, as shown below:
`array.reduce((acc, el) => {})`, where "acc" stands for accumulator and "el" for element.

The second should be an initial value for the accumulator parameter for the callback (the first arg).

### HTML form element 
add `return false` to the onsubmit attribute with a function value, so that the function runs, the web page won't refresh.

### new Set()
is a data structure that only allows unique value by removing any duplicate values. 
So, if you want to check whether there is only one single value in an array, you can use pass the array in Set(); if there is indeed only one single value, the size of Set() should be equal to 1.
