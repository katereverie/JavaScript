- There are two kinds of function: regular function and arrow function.
- An arrow function is sort of a shorter way to write functions. It is *anonymous* in the sense that it has no name. See its syntax:</br>
```() => {}```
- You name an arrow function make assigning it to a const variable which, of course, must be declared with a variable name.
```const variableName = () => {}```
