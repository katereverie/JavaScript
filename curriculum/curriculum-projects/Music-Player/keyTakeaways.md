- There are two kinds of function: regular function and arrow function.
- An arrow function is sort of a shorter way to write functions. It is *anonymous* in the sense that it has no name. See its syntax:</br>
```() => {}```
- You name an arrow function make assigning it to a const variable which, of course, must be declared with a variable name.</br>
```const variableName = () => {}```
- the return keyword is omittable (also no curly brackets necessary) if the expression to be returned is simple. But what is and isn't consider simple expression in JS? Not simple are expressions that have more than one line of code.
