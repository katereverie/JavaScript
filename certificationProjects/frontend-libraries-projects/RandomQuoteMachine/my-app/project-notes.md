# Creating a React App

## Organization & Naming Convention

### Components

1. A file holding a React `Component` starts with a capitalized letter.
2. At the end of the `Component` file, remember to include `export default ComponentName;`.
3. To include the `Component` in your `App Component`, you must go to `App.js` and include at the top: `import ComponentName from './ComponentName';`.
4. `class Component` is no longer in practice; instead, define components as functions. See: https://react.dev/reference/react/Component
