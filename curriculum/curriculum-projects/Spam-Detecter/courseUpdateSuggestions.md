###Step 36
Add a reminder for campers so that campers do not attempt writing a complete regular expression because I assume that there are campers, such as I, that attempt writing a complete regular expression, which will trigger an error message. I attempted at a complete regular expression because there is no other hint that writing a complete regular expression for this part of the challenge is broken down into several steps that come later. So, for clarity, I suggest that a reminder be added to this step since it is the *only* a beginning of several steps to follow. 



## General thoughts on this Curriculum 
I felt the bigger picture is missing during the challenge. 
For some reasons, I keep forgetting what the bigger picture is about. 
Either because it took me more than one single day to finish this curriculum project, leading to forgetting about the bigger picture, or because there is only insufficient reminding campers of the bigger picture, I found myself sometimes forgetting what I am trying to achieve in a specific step and how it is connected to the bigger picture. This, I feel, hinders campers from understanding the neccessary steps required to implement a feature, and what possible ways of implementation there are.
