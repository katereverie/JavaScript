- objects are non primitive data types, meaning they are mutable, meaning primitive data types aren't. 
- primitive data types (short: primitives) of JS are "undefined", "null", "boolean", "number", "string", "symbole".
- keys of objects are of string type, even though when storing keys, as long as they are one character, double quotes aren't necessary.
