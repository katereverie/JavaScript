Q: What is jQuery specifically good for?
A: All major browsers handle JavaScript slightly diferently; jQuery *simplifies* the process of writing *client-side* JavaScript, and ensures that your code works the same way in *all browsers*.

## How to use jQuery?

1. add a `script` element at the *top* of your page. Your browser will run any JS inside a `script` element, including jQuery.
2. Add inside `script`:

  ```js
  $(document).ready(function() {});
  ```

  The code you put inside the function will run as soon as your browser has loaded your page.
  This is crucial because without `document ready function`, your code may run before your HTML is rendered, which could cause bugs.
