- Strings have a .match() method, which accepts a regular expression as an argument and determines if the string matches the expression
- .test() -> Syntax: regexVariable.test(testSubjectVariable);
- arrayVariable.some(arg) checks if testing arg on any of the element of arrayVariable returns true. Take Step 12 from the Curriculum Project for example. This line of code: <br>
`const isSpam = (msg) => denyList.some((regex) => regex.test(msg));` <br>
means, in plain language, that the `isSpam` function variable stores a value of true or false; it takes `msg` as a parameter, and does something with it in the following execution statements: first, call the `.some()` method on the array `denyList` which contains regular expressions (short: regex) that are used to "detect" whether user inputs are spams. There are many ways of doing this. Using the `.some()` method is only one of many. This method takes a *function* as an argument and returns a value of true or false. In our case, the *function* argument is `(regex) => regex.test(msg);`. This callback function implicitly returns the result of `regex.test(msg)` if it is true; or else, it returns false. What does this function do? It takes `regex` as a parameter and call `.test()` method on it which passes `msg` as its argument. What this execution does is this: `regex.test(msg)` tests each `regex` from the array `denyList` by checking whether `msg` contain any of these `regex` from the array list `denyList`. If `msg` matches any `regex` in `denyList`; the callback function should return true; if not match is found, it should return false. Afterwards, the value of true or false will be stored in the `isSpam` function, thus we know that if `isSpam` has or returns the value of true, there is spam contained in the message (`msg`); and if `isSpam` has or returns the value of false, there is no spam detected, at least according to the *given* definition of spam (every `regex` in `denyList`).
